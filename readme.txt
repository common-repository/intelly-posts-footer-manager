One of this few things that isn't under your control when you manage a WordPress site is the Post's footer, the stuff you usually insert after the content of your posts.

There are tons of plugin that insert automatically their widgets after the content, the problem you NEED to verify how they fit with your theme... and you start to modify the theme code or leave a mess because essentially you can't control it.

I bet I can find lots of stuff at the end of your posts and I bet you never had a tool to order the items or space them correctly.

Usually in your blog you have:

1. Share buttons
2. Subscription box
3. Related posts
4. Author bio box
5. Banners
6. Opt-in boxes

Of course your visitors can't decide what to do once read the post, they get confused!

That's why we created Post's Footer Manager

When a visitor read an article or a page on your site and reach the end of the post, you should display the best things in order to keep it on the site or convert into a subscriber.

So, what you need is not an hard coding of your theme, but something that manages and gives you the control of this important part of your site.

With Post's Footer Manager you put your widgets, insert shortcodes, scripts and so on, with an easy drag and drop interface that let you decide what display before, based on a specific category or a key page.

Intact, Post's Footer Manager comes with a well-organized groups and elements that let you decide HOW display your post's footer, cleaning the mess, giving priority at what really matters and reaching a best performance in terms of page views, conversions and time on site.
